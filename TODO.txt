ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);

DESCRIPTION
read() attempts to read nbyte bytes of data from the object referenced by the
descriptor fildes into the buffer pointed to by buf.

int fildes:
The file descriptor of where to read the input.
You can either use a file descriptor obtained from the open system call,
or you can use 0, 1, or 2, to refer to standard input, standard output,
or standard error, respectively.

void *buf:
A character array where the read content will be stored.

size_t nbyte:
The number of bytes to read before truncating the data.
If the data to be read is smaller than nbytes, all data is saved in the buffer.

RETURN VALUES:
Returns the number of bytes that were read.
If value is negative, then the system call returned an error.
